  \item CPU accesses physical memory over a bus
  \item Devices access memory over I/O bus with DMA
  \item Devices can appear to be a region of memory

\begin{slide}{What is memory?}
\itms{
  \item SRAM -- Static RAM
  \ittms{
    \item Like two NOT gates circularly wired input-to-output
    \item 4--6 transistors per bit, actively holds its value
    \item Very fast, used to cache slower memory
  }
  \item DRAM -- Dynamic RAM
  \ittms{
    \item A capacitor + gate, holds charge to indicate bit value
    \item 1 transistor per bit -- extremely dense storage
    \item Charge leaks---need slow comparator to decide if bit 1 or 0
    \item Must re-write charge after reading, and periodically refresh
  }
  \item VRAM -- ``Video RAM''
  \ittms{
    \item Dual ported, can write while someone else reads
  }
}

\section{Device Drivers}

\begin{slide}{Communicating with a device}
\itms{
  \item Memory-mapped device registers
  \ittms{
    \item Certain \emph{physical} addresses correspond to device registers
    \item Load/store gets status/sends instructions -- not real memory
  }
  \item Device memory -- device may have memory OS can write to
	  directly on other side of I/O bus
  \item Special I/O instructions
  \ittms{
    \item Some CPUs (e.g., x86) have special I/O instructions
    \item Like load \& store, but asserts special I/O pin on CPU
    \item OS can allow user-mode access to I/O ports with finer
	  granularity than page
  }
  \item DMA -- place instructions to card in main memory
  \ittms{
    \item Typically then need to ``poke'' card by writing to register
    \item Overlaps unrelated computation with moving data over
  (typically slower than memory) I/O bus
  }
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Memory-mapped IO}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{in}/\texttt{out} instructions slow and clunky
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Instruction format restricts what registers you can use
    \item Only allows $2^{16}$ different port numbers
    \item Per-range access control turns out not to be useful \\
      (any port access allows you to disable all interrupts)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Devices can achieve same effect with physical addresses, e.g.:
\begin{ccode}
    volatile int32_t *device_control = (int32_t *)0xc00c0100;
    *device_control = 0x80; /* Write to control reg */
    int32_t status = *device_control; /* Read status reg */
\end{ccode}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OS must map physical to virtual addresses, ensure
      non-cachable
  \end{itemize}
  \item Assign physical addresses at boot to avoid conflicts.  PCI:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Slow/clunky way to access configuration registers on device
    \item Use that to assign ranges of physical addresses to device
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{slide}{DMA buffers}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.1in]{figs/02x43}}
\itms{
  \item Idea: only use CPU to transfer control requests, not data
  \item Include list of buffer locations in main memory
  \ittms{
    \item Device reads list and accesses buffers through DMA
    \item Descriptions sometimes allow for scatter/gather I/O
  }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Example: Network Interface Card}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{figs/02x42} \\
\end{centering}
\itms{
  \item Link interface talks to wire/fiber/antenna
  \ittms{
    \item Typically does framing, link-layer CRC
  }
  \item FIFOs on card provide small amount of buffering
  \item Bus interface logic uses DMA to move packets to and from
    buffers in main memory
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Example: IDE disk read w.\ DMA}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=70mm]{figs/dma}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Driver architecture}
\itms{
  \item Device driver provides several entry points to kernel
  \ittms{
    \item Reset, ioctl, output, interrupt, read, write, strategy \ldots
  }
  \item How should driver synchronize with card?
  \ittms{
    \item E.g., Need to know when transmit buffers free or packets arrive
    \item Need to know when disk request complete
  }
  \item One approach:  \emph{Polling}
  \ittms{
    \item Sent a packet?  Loop asking card when buffer is free
    \item Waiting to receive?  Keep asking card if it has packet
    \item Disk I/O?  Keep looping until disk ready bit set
  }
  \item Disadvantages of polling?
\pause
  \ittms{
    \item Can't use CPU for anything else while polling
    \item Or schedule poll in future and do something else, but then
	  high latency to receive packet or process disk block
  }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Interrupt driven devices}
\itms{
  \item Instead, ask card to interrupt CPU on events
  \ittms{
    \item Interrupt handler runs at high priority
    \item Asks card what happened (xmit buffer free, new packet)
    \item This is what most general-purpose OSes do
  }
  \item Bad under high network packet arrival rate
  \ittms{
    \item Packets can arrive faster than OS can process them
    \item Interrupts are very expensive (context switch)
    \item Interrupt handlers have high priority
    \item In worst case, can spend 100\% of time in interrupt handler
	  and never make any progress -- \emph{receive livelock}
  \item Best:  Adaptive switching between interrupts
     and polling
  }
  \item Very good for disk requests
  \item Rest of today: Disks
}

        \item Can't predict rotational position after 100-200 revolutions
        }
\item Disk arm assembly
        \ittms{
        \item Arms rotate around pivot, all move together
        \item Pivot offers some resistance to linear shocks
        \item Arms contain disk heads--one for each recording surface
        \item Heads read and write data to platters
        }

\begin{slide}{Storage on a magnetic platter}
\itms{
\item Platters divided into concentric \emph{tracks}
\item A stack of tracks of fixed radius is a \emph{cylinder}
\item Heads record and sense data along cylinders
     \ittms{
     \item Significant fractions of encoded stream for error correction
     }
\item Generally only one head active at a time
     \ittms{
     \item Disks usually have one set of read-write circuitry
     \item Must worry about cross-talk between channels

\itms{
\item Move head to specific track and keep it there
        \ittms{
        \item Resist physical shocks, imperfect tracks, etc.
        }
\item A \textit{seek} consists of up to four phases:
  \ittms{
    \item\textit{speedup}--accelerate arm to max speed or half way point
    \item\textit{coast}--at max speed (for long seeks)
    \item\textit{slowdown}--stops arm near destination
    \item\textit{settle}--adjusts head to actual desired track
}
\item Very short seeks dominated by settle time ($\sim$1 ms)
\item Short (200-400 cyl.)\ seeks dominated by speedup
        \ittms{
        \item Accelerations of ~40g
        }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Seek details}
\itms{
\item Head switches comparable to short seeks
        \ittms{

}
        }
\item Disk keeps table of pivot motor power
        \ittms{
        \item Maps seek distance to power and time
        \item Disk interpolates over entries in table
        \item Table set by periodic ``thermal recalibration''
        \item But, e.g., $\sim$500 ms recalibration every $\sim$25
              min bad for AV

\item ``Average seek time'' quoted can be many things
        \ittms{
        \item Time to seek 1/3 disk, 1/3 time to seek whole disk

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Transfer Time}
$Transfer~Time = Seek~Time + Rotational~Delay + MIN(Bus~Speed, Max~Read~Speed)$

\itms{
\gap
\item $Max~Read~Speed$ is determined by how fast we read sectors off the 
    platter:
\gap
}

$Max~Read~Speed = \frac{RPM}{60 sec/min} \times Bytes~per~Sector \times 
    Sectors~per~Track$

\itms{
\gap
\item $Rotational~Delay$ is how long it takes on average to rotate the platter 
    into position (i.e.~half a rotation of the platter).
\gap

$Rotational~Delay = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{60 sec/min}{RPM}$

	  \alt<1>{(why?)}{\rlap{(sequential access speed)}}
	  \item \textit{Sparing}--flawed sectors remapped elsewhere
	 }
\item OS doesn't know logical to physical sector mapping
	\ittms{
	\item Larger logical sector \# difference means larger seek
	\item Highly non-linear relationship (\textit{and} depends on zone)
	\item OS has no info on rotational positions

\section{SCSI}

\begin{slide}{SCSI overview \cref{sched/readings/scsi.pdf}{[Schmidt]}}
\itms{
  \item SCSI \emph{domain} consists of devices and an SDS
  \ittms{
    \item Devices:  host adapters \& SCSI controllers
    \item \emph{Service Delivery Subsystem} connects devices---e.g., SCSI bus
  }
  \item SCSI-2 bus (SDS) connects up to 8 devices
  \ittms{
    \item Controllers can have $>1$ ``logical units'' (LUNs)
    \item Typically, controller built into disk and 1 LUN/target, but
          ``bridge controllers'' can manage multiple physical devices
  }
  \item Each device can assume role of \emph{initiator} or \emph{target}
  \ittms{
    \item Traditionally, host adapter was initiator, controller target
    \item Now controllers act as initiators (e.g., \textsc{copy} command)
    \item Typical domain has $1$~initiator, $\ge1$ targets
  }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{SCSI requests}
\itms{
  \item A \emph{request} is a command from initiator to target
  \ittms{
    \item Once transmitted, target has control of bus
    \item Target may disconnect from bus and later reconnect \\
       (very important for multiple targets or even multitasking)
  }
  \item Commands contain the following:
  \ittms{
    \item \emph{Task identifier}---initiator ID, target ID, LUN, tag
    \item \emph{Command descriptor block}---e.g., read 10 blocks
	    at pos.\ $N$
    \item Optional \emph{task attribute}---\textsc{simple},
      \textsc{ordered}, \textsc{head of queue}
    \item Optional:  output/input buffer, sense data
    \item \emph{Status byte}---\textsc{good, check condition,
  intermediate}, $\ldots$
  }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Executing SCSI commands}
\itms{
  \item Each LUN maintains a queue of \emph{tasks}
  \ittms{
    \item Each task is \textsc{dormant}, \textsc{blocked},
      \textsc{enabled}, or \textsc{ended}
    \item \textsc{simple} tasks are dormant until no ordered/head of queue
    \item \textsc{ordered} tasks dormant until no HoQ/more recent ordered
    \item \textsc{HoQ} tasks begin in enabled state
  }
  \item Task management commands available to initiator
  \ittms{
    \item Abort/terminate task, Reset target, etc.
  }
  \item Linked commands
  \ittms{
    \item Initiator can link commands, so no intervening tasks
    \item E.g., could use to implement atomic read-modify-write
    \item Intermediate commands return status byte \textsc{intermediate}
  }
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{SCSI exceptions and errors}
\itms{
  \item After error stop executing most SCSI commands
  \ittms{
    \item Target returns with \textsc{check condition} status
    \item Initiator will eventually notice error
    \item Must read specifics w.\ \textsc{request sense}
  }
  \item Prevents unwanted commands from executing
  \ittms{
    \item E.g., initiator may not want to execute 2nd write if 1st fails
  }
  \item Simplifies device implementation
  \ittms{
    \item Don't need to remember more than one error condition
  }
  \item Same mechanism used to notify of media changes

\itms{
  \item Placement \& ordering of requests a huge issue
  \ittms{

    \item More on this in next two lectures
  }
  \item Try to achieve contiguous accesses where possible
  \ittms{

  }
  \item Try to order requests to minimize seek times
  \ittms{
    \item OS can only do this if it has a multiple requests to order

  }
  \item Limited \# overwrites possible
  \ittms{
    \item Blocks wear out after 10,000 (MLC) -- 100,000 (SLC) erases
    \item Requires \emph{flash translation layer} (FTL) to provide

\begin{slide}{Types of flash memory}
\itms{
  \item NAND flash (most prevalent for storage)
  \ittms{
    \item Higher density (most used for storage)

  }
  \item NOR flash
