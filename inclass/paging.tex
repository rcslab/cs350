\fancyhead[R]{\bf Paging}

\begin{document}

Consider a paging-based virtual memory system with 32-bit virtual and physical 
adresses, and a page size of $2^{12}$ bytes (4~KiB).  Suppose that a process P 
is running. P uses only 128~KiB of virtual memory.  The first 5 entries of P's 
page table are shown below.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c}
\toprule
Page \# & Frame \# & Valid \\
\midrule
0x0 & 0x00234 & 1\\
    0x1 & 0x00235 & 1\\
    0x2 & 0x0023f & 1\\
    0x3 & 0x00ace & 1\\
    0x4 & 0x00004 & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
\textbf{Question 1.} What is the total number of entries in a page table?

\vspace{12em}

\noindent
\textbf{Question 2.} How many entries are valid in P's page table?

\vspace{12em}

\textbf{Question 3.} What physical addresses correspond to each of these 
virtual addresses?

\begin{itemize}
\item 0x00001a60
\item 0x00000fb5
\item 0x00004664
\end{itemize}

\break

\textbf{Question 4.} How many bits of the address correspond to the page offset 
and to the virtual page number?

\vspace{14em}

\textbf{Question 5.} If each page table level in a radix-tree is page sized.  
How many bits would be used to index each level of the radix-tree and how many 
levels will you need to describe the entire address space?

\vspace{14em}

\textbf{Question 6.} If the page size were 16~KiB instead of 4~KiB, how many 
entries would there be in P's page table?  How many bits of each virtual 
address would be used for the offset, and how many for the page number?
