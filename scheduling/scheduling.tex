  \ittms{
  \item Have $K$ jobs ready to run
  \item Have $N\ge1$ CPUs

  \item Scheduling decisions may take place when a process:
  \ittms{
    \item[1.] Switches from running to waiting state
    \item[2.] Switches from running to ready state
    \item[3.] Switches from new/waiting to ready
    \item[4.] Exits

\itms{
  \item Why do we care?
  \ittms{
    \item What goals should we have for a scheduling algorithm?
  }
\pause
\item \emph{Throughput} -- \# of procs that complete per unit time
\ittms{
  \item Higher is better
}
\item \emph{Turnaround time} -- time for each proc to complete
\ittms{
  \item Lower is better
}
\item \emph{Response time} -- time from request to first response \\
(e.g., key press to character echo, not launch to exit)
\ittms{
  \item Lower is better
}
\item Above criteria are affected by secondary criteria
\ittms{
  \item \emph{CPU utilization} -- fraction of time CPU doing productive work
  \item \emph{Waiting time} -- time each proc waits in ready queue
}
}

\begin{slide}{Example: FCFS Scheduling}
\itms{
  \item Run jobs in order that they arrive
  \ittms{
    \item Called ``\emph{First-come first-served}'' (FCFS)
    \item E.g.., Say $P_1$ needs 24 sec, while $P_2$ and $P_3$ need 3.
    \item Say $P_2$, $P_3$ arrived immediately after $P_1$, get: \\[4pt]
     \includegraphics[width=3.3in]{figs/fcfs1}
  }
  \item Dirt simple to implement---how good is it?
  \item Throughput: 3 jobs / 30 sec = 0.1 jobs/sec
  \item Turnaround Time: $P_1: 24$, $P_2: 27$, $P_3: 30$
  \ittms{
    \item Average TT: $(24+27+30)/3=27$
  }
  \item Can we do better?
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{FCFS continued}
\itms{
  \item Suppose we scheduled $P_2$, $P_3$, then $P_1$
  \ittms{
    \item Would get:\\[4pt]
     \includegraphics[width=3.3in]{figs/fcfs2}
  }
  \item Throughput: 3 jobs / 30 sec = 0.1 jobs/sec
  \item Turnaround time: $P_1: 30$, $P_2: 3$, $P_3: 6$
  \ittms{
    \item Average TT: $(30+3+6)/3=13$ -- much less than 27
  }
  \item Lesson: scheduling algorithm can reduce TT
  \ittms{
    \item Minimizing waiting time can improve RT and TT
  }
  \item What about throughput?

% %    \item ``special purpose'' = disk drive can only run a disk job, tape
% %      drive a tape job, \ldots

%   \item Scheduling 1-CPU system with $n$ I/O devices like scheduling
%     asymmetric $(n+1)$-CPU multiprocessor

\begin{slide}{SJF Scheduling}
\itms{
  \item \emph{Shortest-job first} (SJF) attempts to minimize TT

    \item Schedule the job whose next CPU burst is the shortest
  }
  \item Two schemes:
  \ittms{

    \item \emph{Non-preemptive} -- once CPU given to the process it
    cannot be preempted until completes its CPU burst

    \item \emph{Preemptive} -- if a new process arrives with CPU burst
length less than remaining time of current executing process, preempt
(Known as the \emph{Shortest-Remaining-Time-First} or SRTF)

  }
\item What does SJF optimize?
\pause
\ittms{
 \item Gives minimum average \emph{waiting time} for a given set of
   processes

\begin{slide}{\only<2>{\hypertarget{sjf-limitations}}SJF limitations}
\itms{
  \item Doesn't always minimize average turnaround time
  \ittms{
    \item Only minimizes waiting time, which minimizes response time
    \item Example where turnaround time might be suboptimal?
    \onslide<2->{\item Overall longer job has shorter bursts}
  }
  \item Can lead to unfairness or starvation
  \item In practice, can't actually predict the future
  \item But can estimate CPU burst length based on past
  \ittms{
    \item Exponentially weighted average a good idea
    \item $t_n$ actual length of proc's $n^\mathrm{th}$ CPU burst
    \item $\tau_{n+1}$ estimated length of proc's $n+1^\mathrm{st}$
    \item Choose parameter $\alpha$ where $0<\alpha\le1$

  \ittms{
    \item Preempt job after some time slice or \emph{quantum}
    \item When preempted, move to back of FIFO queue

    \item Fair allocation of CPU across jobs
    \item Low average waiting time when job lengths vary
    \item Good for responsiveness if small number of jobs

  \item Disadvantages?

\begin{slide}{RR disadvantages}
\itms{

    \ldots what about same-sized jobs?

\begin{slide}{Priority scheduling}
\itms{
\item  Associate a numeric priority with each process
\ittms{
  \item E.g., smaller number means higher priority (Unix/BSD)
}
\item Give CPU to the process with highest priority
\ittms{
  \item Can be done preemptively or non-preemptively
}
\item Note SJF is a priority scheduling where priority is the predicted next CPU burst time

  \item Bound lag with Scheduler Virtual Time (SVT)
  \ittms{
    \item SVT is minimum $A_j$ for all runnable threads $j$
    \item When waking $i$ from voluntary sleep, set
      $A_i\gets\max(A_i,SVT)$
  }
  \item Note voluntary/involuntary sleep distinction
  \ittms{
    \item E.g., Don't reset $A_j$ to SVT after page fault
    \item Faulting thread needs a chance to catch up
    \item But do set $A_i\gets\max(A_i,SVT)$ after socket read
  }
  \item Note: Even with SVT \Red{$A_i$ can never decrease}
  \ittms{
    \item After short sleep, might have $A_i>\mathrm{SVT}$, so
  $\max(A_i,SVT)=A_i$ 
    \item $i$ never gets more than its fair share of CPU in long run

\begin{slide}{Real-time threads}
\itms{
  \item Also want to support soft real-time threads
  \ittms{
    \item E.g., mpeg player must run every 10 clock ticks
  }
  \item Recall $E_i = A_i - (\mathrm{warp}_i \mathrel{?} W_i \mathrel{:} 0)$
  \ittms{
    \item $W_i$ is \emph{warp factor} -- gives thread precedence
    \item Just give mpeg player $i$ large $W_i$ factor
    \item Will get CPU whenever it is runable
    \item But long term CPU share won't exceed $w_i/\sum\limits_j w_j$
  }
  \item Note $W_i$ only matters when $\mathrm{warp}_i$ is \textbf{true}
  \ittms{
    \item Can set $\mathrm{warp}_i$ with a syscall, or have it set in
      signal handler
    \item Also gets cleared if $i$ keeps using CPU for $L_i$ time
    \item $L_i$ limit gets reset every $U_i$ time
    \item $L_i=0$ means no limit -- okay for small $W_i$ value
